# Portfolio-Optimization
Final Project for the "Introduction to Optimization" class, where I explore four different quantitative methods for portfolio selection: Mean Variance Optimization, Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Global Minimum Variance and Risk Parity. Followed by the theoretical framework behind the approaches, the project aims to harness their efficiency by backtesting them on a real world environment. To be precise, we pool 16 different assets across various classes and markets into a portfolio, optimize their weights using the train period data, and compute financial performance metrics on the test period data. Train set contains the timeframe of 2014-2021, an extensive period where both market growth and drawbacks are present, while test set represents a three year period of 2021-2024.
